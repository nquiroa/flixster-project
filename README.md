### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics discussed in the labs provided a strong foundation in React, state management, and API integration, which were crucial for completing the assignment. I felt prepared for implementing more advanced features like creating a modal with animations and handling complex state changes for the "favorites" and "watched" lists due to the help I was able to receive from extra resources such as W3Schools and the Codepath instructors.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have focused on refining the user interface to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly, possibly incorporating animations and transitions for better user experience. Additionally, I would have implemented persistent storage for favorites and watched lists using local storage or a backend database. I would also explore optimizing the search and filter functionalities to handle larger datasets more efficiently.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

The project demo went well in terms of demonstrating core functionalities like searching, filtering, and displaying movie details. I noticed that a peer used a more intuitive design for the pagination controls, which I would like to incorporate in my future projects to enhance user experience.
